## How to add WordPress into your ASP.NET Core app

Use WordPress as [ASP.NET Core Middleware](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-2.2).

1. Add a package reference to `Peachpied.WordPress.AspNetCore` (Pre-Release)
2. Add WordPress as middleware within your `Configure` startup method:

```C#
public class Startup
{
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        // ...
        app.UseWordPress(path: "wordpress");
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Configuration

WordPress on .NET is configured using the standard [`appsettings.json`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/), you are no longer editing the `wp-config.php` source file.

```json
{
  "WordPress": {
    "dbhost":        "localhost",
    "dbpassword":    "password",
    "dbuser":        "root",
    "dbname":        "wordpress",
    "dbTablePrefix": "wp_",
    "SALT": {
      "AUTH_KEY":         "r(EoMbKEvlg){+!T42fh-e+~IGj-4q}g8HHB9hjbiC0J*ySU1Y*3z[3c}F;6=TA5",
      "AUTH_SALT":        "q0#AzvJ*[4~Bexa9*M(sC_#pDuGQBdjL1}j*RilSe0ku]P~KuTir[7PxjE:4)_zR",
      "LOGGED_IN_KEY":    "!AAienFSridCUzF(v}m#}_;+t%Rclg;mOPKwe;w7dN0M{d,]?8V+TRW_UG)tSswa",

      "NONCE_KEY":        "Z[e37@=y)m.CHa:OSldh#RT@nIZxKYGwu!/hd:vK#^{_Ec7e{KNb(G.8ch/MkH(d",
      "NONCE_SALT":       ";v7Wv/BV)Pz{W,FaAKC0buH*5U4:g]qn~;b94x]f8=lm6!yyYSbW5*2y*kRXXEF5",
      "SECURE_AUTH_KEY":  "pc}_Pv52,m=j9l#llSkLVQib.Zm!;9FRzg:{(G]tM8}[}]pPDwB4k{xV+!e)9lmR",
      "SECURE_AUTH_SALT": "#n]+o^w/%-~MVzf{AUuxUAwF[n03r{kr^r1V?wqQ?Vjt}!0HSkCB-):u-ra1%tB="
    },
    "constants": {
    }
  }
}
```

To generate your unique set of `SALT`, feel free to use Daniel Llewellyn's tool on https://wpdotnet-salts.azurewebsites.net/.

Note: WordPress expects the MySql database to be running, with the database `dbname` already created. Otherwise you'll get an error. Any of the configuration values can be omitted to use the default value.

## Running this repo from the sources:

1. Start mysql, at `localhost:3306`, user `root`, password `password`, created database `wordpress`
2.
    - **cmd:** `dotnet run -p app`
    - **vs:** open solution and start `app` project
    - **vscode**: open folder and hit `F5`


## WordPress on .NET SDK

The solution provides all of WordPress as a .NET standard assembly. Consisting of following projects:

- **app** is a demo project that runs WordPress as a part of ASP.NET Core application.
- **PeachPied.WordPress** contains the sources of WordPress that are compiled into a single .NET standard assembly (`PeachPied.WordPress.dll`). Together with its content files it is packed into a NuGet package `PeachPied.WordPress`. The project contains additional files:
  - `wp-content/mu-plugins/peachpie-api.php` is a "must-use" plugin exposing the WordPress API to .NET.
  - `wp-dummy.php` declaring dummy classes required but not used by most plugins to be compiled successfully.
- **PeachPied.WordPress.Standard** defines an abstraction layer providing .NET interfaces over the PHP WordPress instance. The interface is implemented and provided by `peachpie-api.php` above.
- **PeachPied.WordPress.AspNetCore** is an ASP.NET Core request handler that configures the ASP.NET pipeline to pass requests to compiled `WordPress` scripts. The configuration includes response caching, short URL mapping, various .NET enhancements and the settings of the WordPress database.

This project contains the complete source code of WordPress with the additional "must use" WordPress plugin that exposes the PHP API to .NET. The purpose is for this code to be compiled by PeachPie, resulting in the output running purely on Microsoft .NET Core. 

Therefore, if everything works as it should, you will see the standard unchanged WordPress in the same way as you would in the traditional PHP version. The difference is that the compiled website runs on .NET Core in the background. Also this approach allows to take advantage of ASP.NET Core request handling and makes it possible to extend WordPress with C# (i.e. plugins, themes, etc.).

## Possible Use Cases

- **Improve performance**: compiled code is fast and also optimized by the .NET 'JITter' for your actual system. Additionally, the .NET performance profiler may be used to resolve bottlenecks.
- **Write plugins in C#**: plugin functionality can be implemented in a separate C# project and/or PHP plugins may use .NET libraries. Utilize .NET with all its advantages like sourceless distribution or type safe and compiled code, which is further optimized and checked for the actual platform.
- **Integrate WP into a .NET application**: drive the WordPress life cycle from a C# app, run within the Kestrel Web Server.
- **Sourceless distribution**: after the compilation, most of the source files are not needed. Some files contain meta-data (like plugins and themes) and should be kept in the output.
- **Take advantage** of the .NET runtime: JITted, secure and manageable platform.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core 2.1 or newer
- MySQL server
- Optionally - Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio Code using the official Peachpie for VSCode extension available on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iolevel.peachpie-vscode)
